      <h3>Korean drama</h3>
      <p>Korean dramas, more popularly known as K-dramas, are television series in the Korean language, made in South
        Korea. Korean dramas are popular worldwide, partially due to the spread of Korean popular culture (the "Korean
        Wave"), and their widespread availability via streaming services which often offer subtitles in multiple
        languages. Many K-dramas have been adapted throughout the world, and some have had great impact on other
        countries. Some of the most famous dramas have been broadcast via traditional television channels in other
        countries. For example, Dae Jang Geum (2003) was sold to 150 countries. K-dramas have attracted attention for
        their fashion, style and culture all over the world. The rise in popularity of Korean dramas had led to a great
        boost to fashion lines. However, various Korean dramas have also been criticized for their attempts to take
        advantage of such popularity to distort, rewrite or whitewash Korea's history, especially during South Korea's
        dictatorship regimes or the nation's historical periods. As they constitute an important aspect of South Korea's
        soft power projection to "brand and publicize" the country, some K-dramas have also been criticized by Korean
        nationalists who feel that do not adequately "glorify the nation" enough.</p>

      <h3>Production</h3>
      <p>Korean series were originally produced in-house by the television channels themselves, but have been outsourced
        to independent companies since the 2000s. In 2012, as much as 75% of all K-dramas were produced this way.
        Competition is fierce among these companies; out of 156 registered firms, only 34 of them produced dramas that
        were actually aired in 2012.
        <br><br>
        In the late 2010s, a typical Korean drama may cost as much as ₩700 million per episode. Historical dramas have a
        bigger budget; one episode of the historical romance The Red Sleeve cost as much as ₩950 million.[40] Recently,
        factors such as improving the work environment, along with whether to sign contracts with domestic and foreign
        OTT companies such as Netflix have served as variables. For example, Kingdom had a budget of ₩2 billion per
        episode, while ₩3 billion were spent on each episode of Sweet Home.
        <br><br>
        Often, production companies overrun their budgets and cannot pay salaries. In 2012, actors held a demonstration
        in front of the headquarters of KBS, expressing their concerns. Actors are usually paid after the last episode
        is aired. In series made by smaller production companies, there have been cases where the companies went
        bankrupt and could not pay their actors and crew, while the channel denied all responsibility, claiming all
        liability was with the bankrupt production firm. Producer Kim Jong-hak spent ₩10 billion on Faith, which was
        considered a commercial failure, resulting in the inability of Kim to pay crew salaries and other overheads.
        Kim, who had produced iconic dramas such as Eyes of Dawn and Sandglass, committed suicide after he was accused
        of embezzlement.
        <br><br>
        The biggest stars may earn more than ₩200 million per episode, with Kim Soo-hyun, the lead of hit dramas Moon
        Embracing the Sun (2012), My Love from the Star (2013) and It's Okay to Not Be Okay (2020) reportedly receiving
        ₩500 million per episode for One Ordinary Day in 2021.
      </p>
      <h4>Filmmaking process</h4>
      <p>As producing a series involves high expenses, production companies seek to shoot the episodes in the shortest
        time possible. In contrast to practices elsewhere, the first four episodes of Korean series are usually shot in
        advance, but the rest are shot continuously as the series is being aired. Scripts are not finished in advance,
        and may change according to viewer feedback and viewership ratings, where popular characters receive increased
        screen time and plotlines are changed to match audience expectations. These changes may occur a few hours before
        daily shooting, and the crew might receive only a few ready pages. The production usually works with three
        camera crews, who work in a rotating manner to speed up filming. Because of unregulated script changes and tight
        shooting schedules, actors are almost continuously on standby, and have no time to leave the set or sleep
        properly. The Korean media have a separate word to describe irregular, short sleeps that actors resort to, in
        often uncomfortable positions, or within the set: jjok-jam (쪽잠), or "side-sleeping". Dramas usually air on two
        days every week, with following episodes having to be shot within the intervening five days. Some Korean actors
        have admitted to receiving IV therapy during filming, due to extreme schedules and exhaustion. Nonetheless, the
        live-shoot model remains widely used since the production team can react to real time audience feedback.
        <br><br>
        Production teams originally sent two tapes to the channels; a primary copy and a backup copy. However, due to
        the tight filming schedules, a 70-minute episode might arrive at the broadcasting station on seven separate
        tapes in ten-minute installments. It happened that while the episode is being broadcast, the crew would be still
        shooting the last minutes or cutting the rest of the episode. During the airing of the nineteenth episode of Man
        from the Equator, screens countrywide went black for 10 minutes. Actor Kwon Sang-woo was openly complaining that
        he was still shooting King of Ambition 30 minutes before the last episode began airing.[44] In South Korea, some
        production teams still do planning and scheduling manually, instead of using dedicated software.
        <br><br>
        In 2016, dramas such as Descendants of the Sun, Uncontrollably Fond, Moon Lovers: Scarlet Heart Ryeo and
        Hwarang: The Poet Warrior Youth were all pre-produced before airing. Nonetheless, some pre-produced episodes are
        often re-edited or even reshot the day of airing, due to audience feedback.
        <br><br>
        The larger broadcasting companies have their own dedicated shooting locations for historical dramas, with
        extensive and elaborate sets. MBC's series are shot at the Yongin Daejanggeum Park in Gyeonggi Province, while
        KBS dramas utilize the Mungyeongsaejae Studio (KBS) in North Gyeongsang Province and their studio in Suwon.
      </p>
      <h4>Production companies</h4>
      <p>Independent production companies are classified as follows:
      <ul>
        <li>Those founded and/or owned by industry veterans (e.g. Kim Jong-hak Production, Logos Film, iWill Media)</li>
        <li>Owned by the broadcast companies (e.g. Studio S, Monster Union, MBC C&I, JTBC Studios)</li>
        <li>Owned by entertainment companies (e.g. Studio Dragon, LOTTE CULTUREWORKS, SM Life Design Group, YG
          STUDIOPLEX, studio&NEW, Studio Santa Claus Entertainment)</li>
        <li>Big-tier (e.g. Pan Entertainment, Chorokbaem Media)</li>
        <li>Small-tier</li>
      </ul>
      </p>

      <h3>Crew</h3>
      <h4>Actors and actresses</h4>
      <p>In the 2000s, it became customary to cast popular K-pop idols in dramas. Initially, this generated mixed
        reactions. Their appearance had provoked predominantly negative reactions outside their fandom because singers
        and dancers acting outside of their musical circle was regarded as unprofessional. Also, some idols were
        criticized for poor acting. Nowadays, this has become much more common feature in Korean dramas, as the public
        has been getting more used to the concept of "idol actors" and some idols have become known for their excellent
        acting skills. Their critical reception is still mixed, however, some of them, like Bae Suzy, IU, Seo In-guk,
        Blackpink's Jisoo, Ok Taec-yeon, Park Jin-young, Doh Kyung-soo and Im Yoon-ah, became successful as actors and
        actresses.
        <br><br>
        There were also instances of children taking up careers as child actors or actresses, usually portraying either
        the younger versions of some characters or the children of the adult characters from dramas. Subsequently, there
        were some child actors and actresses who continue pursuing acting careers even after reaching adulthood, and
        with some achieving success even after adulthood. Notably, such people include actors like Yoon Chan-young, Park
        Solomon, Yoo Seung-ho and Yeo Jin-goo; and actresses like Kim So-hyun, Lee Se-young, Nam Ji-hyun, Kim Hyang-gi,
        Moon Geun-young, Park Shin-hye, Kim Sae-ron and Kim Yoo-jung.
      </p>
      <h4>Scriptwriters and directors</h4>
      <p>Scriptwriters and directors of Korean dramas are often as well known as actors are. An overwhelming majority of
        scriptwriters (90% according to the Beijing Metro Reader) are women, who not only write love stories but action
        series as well. Compared to Korean cinema, television is more appealing for scriptwriters as contract conditions
        are better, acknowledgment is greater, and the salary is higher.
        <br><br>
        Famous scriptwriters tend to have a say in their field. The most well-known scriptwriters include the Hong
        sisters, who wrote popular series such as My Girl, You're Beautiful and My Girlfriend Is a Gumiho; Kim Soon-ok,
        the screenwriter of The Penthouse: War in Life, The Last Empress, Band of Sisters, Jang Bo-ri is Here! and
        Temptation of Wife; Kim Eun-sook, the screenwriter of Lovers in Paris, Secret Garden, The Heirs, Descendants of
        the Sun and Guardian: The Lonely and Great God; Lee Kyung-hee, famous for I'm Sorry, I Love You and The Innocent
        Man; male writer Choi Wan-kyu of Midas and Triangle; Noh Hee-kyung, the author of That Winter, the Wind Blows;
        and It's Okay, That's Love; and Park Ji-eun, who wrote My Husband Got a Family, My Love from the Star, The
        Producers, Legend of the Blue Sea and Crash Landing on You. In particular, writer Kim Soon-ok is famous for
        captivating male viewers who did not watch dramas well. In 2021, an article called "Kim Soon-ok, Kim Eun-sook,
        and Kim Eun-hee" was also published, referring to star writers.
        <br><br>
        Acknowledged TV directors include Lee Byung-hoon, who directed Hur Jun, Dae Jang Geum and Yi San; Kim Jong-hak,
        the director of Eyes of Dawn, Sandglass, The Legend and Faith;, Pyo Min-soo, the director of Full House, Worlds
        Within and Iris II and Jang Tae-yoo who directed War of Money, Painter of the Wind, Deep Rooted Tree , My Love
        from the Star and Hyena. In recent years, director Jo Hyun-tak was also propelled to fame through his works Sky
        Castle, which became one of the highest rated dramas in Korean cable television history, and Snowdrop, which,
        despite its alleged historical distortions, was ranked first among the most-watched series on Disney+ in Asian
        countries like Singapore and South Korea.
        <br><br>
        While scriptwriters are mostly women, directors are usually men. Some female directors have risen to prominence,
        such as Lee Na-jeong, who directed The Innocent Man, and Lee Yun-jeong, whose most famous works are Coffee
        Prince and Heart to Heart. The latter director is also the first female television producer employed by Munhwa
        Broadcasting Corporation (MBC).

      <h3>Rating system</h3>
      <p>The television rating system is regulated by the Korea Communications Commission, and was implemented in 2000.
        According to the system, programs, including Korean dramas, are rated according to the following principles
        (ratings irrelevant to dramas are omitted):
      <ul>
        <li><img class="rating"
            src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/Republic_Of_Korea_Broadcasting-TV_Rating_System%2812%29.svg/250px-Republic_Of_Korea_Broadcasting-TV_Rating_System%2812%29.svg.png"
            alt="Rated 12 and over" />: programs that may be inappropriate for children under
          12, such as mild violence, suggestive themes or language.</li>
        <li><img class="rating"
            src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Republic_Of_Korea_Broadcasting-TV_Rating_System%2815%29.svg/250px-Republic_Of_Korea_Broadcasting-TV_Rating_System%2815%29.svg.png"
            alt="Rated 15 and over" />: programs that may be inappropriate for children under 15.
          Most dramas and talk shows are rated this way. These programs may include moderate or strong adult themes,
          language, sexual inference, and violence.</li>
        <li><img class="rating"

            alt="Rated 19 and over" />: programs intended for adults only. These programs might
          include adult themes, sexual situations, frequent use of strong language and disturbing scenes of violence.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Reception</h3>
      <p>According to a researcher at the University of Vienna, popularity of Korean dramas have their foundation in
        Confucian values they transmit, which Asian viewers can easily identify with. Respect for elders, filial piety,
        family-orientedness, and the display of perceived "Asian moral values" play an important role in Korean series.
        YA Entertainment, the American distributor of Korean dramas, believes that part of the attractiveness of these
        series come from the quality of camera work, scenic locations, and spectacular costumes, which make the "final
        product very stylish and attractive, with arguably some of the highest TV production values in the world."
        Korean series follow their own formula, are innovative and don't conform to Western television productions.
        Stephan Lee from Entertainment Weekly called Korean dramas "fascinating and weirdly comforting".
        <br><br>
        Exports of Korean series yielded US$37.5 million in 2003, which was three times higher than the amount reached
        in 1999. According to data from Korea Creative Content Agency, in 2013 K-dramas constituted 82% of the culture
        content export of South Korea, with an income of $167 million, which is four times more than a decade before.
        <br><br>
        A driving force behind the rising popularity is the intense involvement of fans. Because of the live-shooting
        production of K-dramas, Korean-speaking fans have the opportunity to participate in their creation[91]—a unique
        phenomenon in the mass media world. They can influence the content of later shows in the series through
        complaints and suggestions, which are frequently adopted by the production teams.
        <br><br>
        The global community of non-Korean-speaking fans, on the other hand, is more involved in the consumption
        aspects: Fans share their opinions through tweets and comments on newsgroups (for example, the Soompi discussion
        forum) as well as reviews and recaps on websites and blogs. However, the impact of their social media activity
        goes beyond the fan community. It spreads the word about the K-drama genre to social connections like
        acquaintances, friends and family (e.g. Facebook friends or followers on Twitter) and thereby generally raises
        its popularity. But it also has an effect on the creation of new dramas. It influences the popularity of certain
        dramas, leading to higher demand for those videos from streaming sites and additional income for broadcasters.
        When a substantial profit results, it raises not only the prestige of people involved in the production but also
        provides feedback for production teams and indirectly influences future productions.
      </p>
      <h4>International reception in East Asia</h4>
      <p>In China, South Korean programs on Chinese government TV networks accounted for more than all other foreign
        programs combined in 2006. Hong Kong has its own channel for airing Korean dramas, TVB J2, but ATV also airs
        Korean series in prime-time slots. My Love from the Star received enthusiastic feedback from China. It was
        viewed 40 billion times on numerous Chinese video sites. The drama also spurred interest about Korea, shown by
        China's increased consumption of Korean products such as Chi Maek (chicken and beer) and Korean cosmetics. Due
        to the success of Korean dramas in China, some dramas have been compiled to create feature-length films by
        combining all episodes into one film. The prodigious popularity of Korean dramas in the country has, on some
        occasions, been caught in the crossfire over diplomatic issues between China and South Korea. Most notable being
        the THAAD deployment in South Korea which resulted in the blocking of Korean dramas on streaming services across
        the country in late February 2017. Following the block, Chinese TV shows showcasing Chinese culture and other
        similar content replaced Korean content on TV networks' prime time schedules in the country. In November 2017,
        the ban was lifted unannounced following the appearance of Kpop groups on national TV and the move to resume
        importation of Korean dramas by Chinese streaming services. In China, apps like IQiyi, which is currently also
        available in Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan and some other countries in multiple different subtitles, are available
        to stream and download Korean dramas for viewing.
        <br><br>
        The first Korean drama to gain widespread popularity in Japan was Winter Sonata, which was broadcast on the NHK
        satellite channel NHK BS2 in 2003. The program was aired twice in the same year due to high demand from viewers.
        NHK also hosted a classical concert featuring Winter Sonata's tunes performed by Korean musicians. Korean dramas
        boost tourism between Korea and Japan, and is considered a possible way of improving strained relationships
        between the two countries, as series have become increasingly popular with Japanese viewers. Conversely, the
        series Iris had several pivotal scenes shot in Akita, Japan, which led to an increase of Korean tourists in that
        part of Japan.
        <br><br>
        In Mongolia, Korean dramas have become popular and are broadcast at prime time. Dae Jang Geum achieved success
        in the country and was broadcast five times due to this. Autumn in My Heart, Winter Sonata and Stairway to
        Heaven were other popular dramas. Popularity in Korean dramas has resulted in interest in the learning of the
        Korean language as well as Mongolians travelling to South Korea. It has also led to increased mutually
        cooperative relations between Mongolia and South Korea.
        <br><br>
        Watching films or TV dramas from South Korea is a serious offence in North Korea, punishable by execution, but
        people still manage to acquire them on CDs and DVDs. In 2021, there was an article that young people who were
        watching the popular drama The Penthouse: War in Life were caught in Pyeongseong, Pyeongnam Province, and will
        have to serve more than 10 years. Later, the residents of Yanggang Province began to imitate the famous lines
        from the Penthouse series, and the residents were also unable to avoid punishment.
        <br>In Taiwan, interest in Korean dramas began when Star in My Heart aired in 1999. Since then Korean dramas
        have become very popular and according to the South Korean mission 120 K-dramas had been broadcast in Taiwan in
        the first half of 2011.<br>
      </p>
      <h4>International reception in Southeast Asia</h4>
      <p>In recent times Korean dramas have experienced growing popularity in Brunei. The growing impact of Korean
        culture in Brunei led to the hosting of the ninth Korea Forum in the country at Universiti Brunei Darussalam in
        2010. Korean television dramas, movies, music, and clothing have had a great impact on the people of Brunei.
        <br><br>
        The first Korean drama to be broadcast in Cambodia was Winter Sonata; it was, however, Full House that launched
        the interest in Korean dramas and entertainment in the country. Following the success of Full House, more Korean
        dramas have been dubbed into the Khmer language. Korean dramas have become popular particularly amongst youth in
        Cambodia.
        <br><br>
        In Indonesia, Korean dramas have gained popularity and the popular Korean dramas Winter Sonata and Endless Love
        were aired on Surya Citra Media in 2002. Some Korean dramas have also been remade into Indonesian versions such
        as Demi Cinta in 2005 which was a remake of the popular drama Autumn in My Heart and Cinta Sejati, a remake of
        Stairway to Heaven. RCTI and Indosiar are examples of Indonesian television networks that air Korean dramas in
        the early times, but later Trans TV airing some of popular Korean dramas until today.
        <br><br>
        The popularity of Korean dramas and pop culture in Laos has led to many Laotian tourists travelling to South
        Korea. Korean pop culture has gained popularity in Laos through the Thai TV channels broadcasting Korean dramas
        and K-pop bands in the country.
        <br><br>
        In Malaysia, Winter Sonata began airing on TV3 in 2003, which started an interest in Korean pop culture in the
        country. Dae Jang Geum and Autumn In My Heart were also aired in Malaysia. The popularity of Korean dramas have
        resulted in a positive reception of Korean expatriates in Malaysia.
        <br><br>
        In Myanmar, the K-drama Autumn in My Heart was broadcast in the country in 2001, which led to interest in Korean
        entertainment. When Dae Jang Geum was on air, the drama sparked an interest in Korean cuisine in the country.
        The rising popularity of Korean dramas and music in Myanmar has led to the Korea Foundation for International
        Culture Exchange (KOFICE) distributing Korean dramas in the country for free.
        <br><br>
        In the Philippines, Korean dramas are politically popular on free-to-air television since 2003. In the past two
        decades, GMA Network has the highest number of Korean dramas broadcast in the Philippines.
        <br><br>
        In Singapore, Prime 12 (now known as Suria) originally aired the Korean drama Sandglass on a weekly basis in
        1996 and aired Asphalt Man in 1997. Since 2001, they are shown on Chinese language channel MediaCorp Channel U
        daily. The launch of KBS World, ONE TV ASIA, Oh!K, Channel M and streaming app, Viu in Singapore allows viewers
        to watch Korean dramas with a variety of subtitles in a matter of hours after the original South Korean
        telecast. Currently, Singaporeans also get access to Korean dramas through China-originated online platform
        IQIYI, which first soft-launched its app in 2019 and planned to expand its international bases in Singapore.
        <br><br>
        When Dae Jang Geum was on air in Thailand, Korean food started gaining wide popularity. Due to the lop-sided
        nature of entertainment exports favoring South Korea, the Thai government requested increased introduction of
        popular Thai films to South Korean media outlets. This led to the signing of an Agreement of Cultural
        Cooperation between the two countries in August 2004.
        <br><br>
        Korean dramas have also gained popularity in Vietnam, particularly among women and young people. The fashion and
        hairstyles presented in Korean dramas have become very popular among the youth of the country.
      </p>
      <h4>International reception in South Asia</h4>
      <p>Korean dramas have gained popularity in Bangladesh in recent years. Their rising popularity in the country has
        led to the Korea Foundation for International Culture Exchange (KOFICE), an organisation which aims to
        distribute Korean dramas for free to countries, cooperating with broadcasters to distribute Korean dramas for
        free in the country. With the growing number of K-drama fans in Bangladesh, more and more Facebook groups are
        popping up, giving them a platform to share their love of the shows with fellow K-drama enthusiasts and take
        part in events and activities hosted by the groups. One of the largest Bangladeshi K-Drama groups, BD K-Family,
        arranges a yearly get together for its members. Other popular Facebook K-Drama groups include K-Drama Archive
        BD, Korean Lovers Bangladesh, and BD Korean Drama Fam- all of which create opportunities for both local and
        international fans to participate in discussions about their favourite shows.
        <br><br>
        In the Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan, Korean dramas and entertainment have gained popularity particularly amongst
        youth. Prior to interest in Korean entertainment, Bollywood had largely been the most popular form of
        entertainment in the country. When the Bhutanese film industry launched in the mid-1990s, Bollywood was the only
        form of influence on the industry. However, in recent years Korean entertainment has made significant inroads in
        the country and influence the entertainment industry alongside Bollywood. Korean entertainment has managed to
        influence fashion, and many video shops now sell Korean dramas and movies alongside Bollywood films. The
        interest in Korean entertainment has also led to controversy with older generations voicing their concern that
        Korean entertainment will deteriorate Bhutanese culture and traditions.

        In India, after the late 1990s and around 2000 Korean dramas started becoming popular through piracy
        particularly in north-eastern states such as Manipur, Assam, Meghalaya, Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh, Tripura,
        Mizoram and Nagaland as well as parts of eastern state like West Bengal and more recently in southern states
        like Kerala, Telangana, Tamil Nadu. Hindi films and TV serials were banned in Manipur in 2000, as a result local
        television stations began broadcasting subtitled Korean dramas instead from Arirang TV and KBS World. Many young
        people in north-eastern, eastern, northern and southern parts of India mimic the hairstyles, clothes of Korean
        actors while Korean fashion became very popular in the region. As part of cultural exchange, public broadcaster
        Doordarshan telecasted Emperor of the Sea and Dae Jang Geum. Korean dramas are dubbed in Tamil on Puthuyugam TV
        such as 'Boys over flowers', 'My love from another star', 'Playful Kiss' and many more. Full House and Hwang
        Jini started airing on Firangi channel in 2008. Reliance Big TV offered KBS World to its subscribers from 2009
        on satellite television. Local fan clubs got help from Consul-General of the Republic of Korea while Korean
        Cultural Centre in India (KCCI) under South Korean embassy started mapping popularity of K-dramas. As per KCCI,
        the motivation to understand Korean drama properly without subtitles is driving the uptake of Korean language
        classes among the youth with females outnumbering males. DD Bharati broadcast period drama Hur Jun in 2014 that
        received highest viewer ratings of 34 million from January to October 2014. Online streaming platform ZEE5
        launched Descendants of the Sun to test the Indian market from 8 February to 1 March 2017 and found overwhelming
        positive response for Korean content with viewership ran close to 56 million. The telecast of Korean drama on
        Cable TV in 2017 stopped as Korean Broadcasting System Network wanted to raise syndication charges due to
        accumulation of large viewer-ship base in India that included pockets of Bihar, Kerala and Uttar Pradesh due to
        short 16 to 20 episodes format that are easier for binge-watching. With increasing interest in Korean content
        among younger generation from tier-1 cities, Samsung through its My Galaxy mobile application is partnering with
        Korean Broadcasting System (KBS) in 2019 to bring exclusive content for 20 million Indian users. With COVID-19
        pandemic, Dish TV started premium K-dramas dubbed in Hindi and Tamil. Korean dramas are also driving highest
        viewer-ship on Netflix with second season of TV series Kingdom attained the Top 10 series row as of March 2020.
        It's Okay to Not Be Okay is on Netflix Top 10 list in India for several weeks in August 2020 which has jumped to
        number 3 position. Netflix is increasing investment on Korean content to capture the Indian market. Over-the-top
        media service (OTT) MX Player confirmed rising popularity and demand of Korean dramas among millennial
        population especially the women audience and is now making deals with South Korean television and radio network
        company Seoul Broadcasting System (SBS) to bring more content in India. Korean dramas and films became most
        visited category for ShortsTV in India. As per media experts, the relatable themes in Korean content is fast
        catching the imagination of general public of almost every age group that is going mainstream and driving
        highest viewing especially after 92nd Academy Awards winning movie Parasite due to the shared Asian cultural
        heritage and societal values. As per Parrot Analytics report, k-drama series 'Crash Landing on You', is on
        demand 1.2 times than an average TV series that is 89.8% more than all drama titles shown in India forcing
        broadcasters to make extra slots as women are at the forefront of consumer demand in Korean content category.
        The COVID-19 lockdown in India proved to be an inflection point in 2020–2021 when Korean drama moved from a
        niche sub-culture segment to mainstream due to services like Netflix, Rakuten Viki and YouTube. It penetrated to
        every age group and social background. The popularity of Korean drama forced many over-the-top media service in
        India such as MX Player, Viu and ZEE5 to bring the dubbed versions in local language that will help cater to
        large non English speaking audience.
        <br><br>
        Interest for Korean dramas in the Nepal began when Winter Sonata aired on Kantipur Television Network in the
        mid-2000s. This led to the popularity of other K-dramas such as Boys Over Flowers, Autumn In My Heart, You Are
        Beautiful and Full House to name a few. Popularity of Korean media products has also led to interest of learning
        the Korean language and has resulted in the emergence of Korean language tutorials that air on ABC Television in
        the country. Korean dramas have become popular among Nepali youth and markets are often frequented by teenagers
        looking to buy the latest dramas. The hairstyles and fashion of Korean actors have influenced the fashion sense
        of Nepali youth. Fascinated by the lifestyle and food of Korea, restaurants serving Korean cuisine have also
        been established in the country.
        <br><br>
        In Sri Lanka, the Independent Television Network aired Full House in 2009 and it proved popular. Dae Jang Geum
        aired on Rupavahini in 2012 and was dubbed in Sinhala under the title Sujatha Diyani (සුජාත දියණී), meaning "The
        Pure, Valuable Daughter" and received a viewer rate of over 90%.[165] The Independent Television Network,
        Rupavahini, TV Derana, Sirasa TV, Swarnavahini and TV1 air Korean dramas dubbed in the Sinhalese language.
        Streaming service, Iflix also streams many Korean dramas with English and Sinhalese subtitles in the country,
        some as early as 24 hours after their original Korean broadcast.[168] Additionally, the popularity of Korean pop
        culture in the country has led to an increasingly warm reception towards Korean people.
        <br><br>
        Since the mid-2000s, Israel, Iran, Morocco and Egypt have become major consumers of Korean culture. Following
        the success of Korean dramas in the Middle East & North Africa, the Korean Overseas Information Service made
        Winter Sonata available with Arabic subtitles on several state-run Egyptian television networks. According to
        Youna Kim (2007), "The broadcast was part of the government's efforts to improve the image of South Korea in the
        Middle East, where there is little understanding and exposure towards Korean culture". The New York Times
        reported that the intent behind this was to contribute towards positive relations between Arab & Berber
        audiences and South Korean soldiers stationed in northern Iraq. MBC4 (Middle East Broadcasting Channel) played a
        major role in increasing the Korean wave's popularity in the MENA region (Middle East and North Africa). This
        broadcasting channel hosted a series of Korean drama starting 2013 such as "Boys Over Flowers", "You're
        Beautiful", "Dream High", "Coffee Prince". Some Arab countries opposed Korean content (dramas, reality show) out
        of fear that their youth would abandon Islamic traditions in order to adopt Western modernity. However, this did
        not stop the Korean industries from exporting more Korean Dramas to the Arab world in the following years such
        as "The Heirs". The popularity of Korean dramas in the MENA region-and its continuous growth- originates from
        the content of these dramas. As the majority of the plots of Korean dramas focus on social issues (love between
        different social classes or family problems for instance), the Arab audiences fit themselves and could relate to
        the Korean socio-cultural values as they seem appealing to them. So Korean dramas play the role of an
        equilibrium point where two, somehow, different cultures could create a new cultural space where these two
        different cultures could meet.
        <br><br>
        Iran's state broadcaster, Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB), aired several Korean dramas during prime
        time slots in recent years, with this decision attributed by some to their Confucian values of respect for
        others, which are "closely aligned to Islamic culture", while in contrast, Western productions often fail to
        satisfy the criteria set by Iran's Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance. In October 2012, the Tehran Times
        reported that IRIB representatives visited South Korea to visit filming locations in an effort to strengthen
        "cultural affinities" between the two countries and to seek avenues for further cooperation between KBS and
        IRIB. According to Reuters, until recently audiences in Iran have had little choice in broadcast material and
        thus programs that are aired by IRIB often attain higher viewership ratings in Iran than in South Korea; for
        example, the most popular episodes of Jumong attracted over 90% of Iranian audience (compared to 40% in South
        Korea), propelling its lead actor Song Il-gook to superstar status in Iran.
        <br><br>
        In the early 2000s, Korean dramas were aired for South Korean troops stationed in northern Iraq as part of
        coalition forces led by the United States during the Iraq War. With the end of the war and the subsequent
        withdrawal of South Korean military personnel from the country, efforts were made to expand availability of
        K-dramas to the ordinary citizens of Iraq. In 2012, the Korean drama Hur Jun reportedly attained a viewership of
        over 90% in the Kurdistan region of Iraq. Its lead actor Jun Kwang-ryul was invited by the federal government of
        Iraq to visit the city of Sulaymaniyah in Kurdistan, at the special request of the country's First Lady, Hero
        Ibrahim Ahmed.
        <br><br>
        Autumn in My Heart, one of the earliest Korean dramas brought over to the Middle East, was made available for
        viewing after five months of "persistent negotiations" between the South Korean embassy and an Egyptian
        state-run broadcasting company. Shortly after the series ended, the embassy reported that it had received over
        400 phone calls and love letters from fans from all over the country. According to the secretary of the South
        Korean embassy in Cairo Lee Ki-seok, Korea's involvement in the Iraq War had significantly undermined its
        reputation among Egyptians, but the screening of Autumn in My Heart proved "extremely effective" in reversing
        negative attitudes.

      <h4>International reception in Europe</h4>
      <p>The first Korean drama in Romania was aired on TVR in August 2009 with Dae Jang Geum, and in the following
        month it became the third most popular television program in the country. Since then, Korean dramas have seen
        high ratings and further success.
      </p>
      <h4>International reception in North America</h4>
      <p>The Asian American-targeted cable TV channels AZN Television and ImaginAsian aired Korean dramas alongside
        content from China, Japan, India, Thailand and other parts of Asia. The dramas were aimed at the Asian American
        community before the channels dissolved in 2008 and 2011 respectively.

        The Asian American-targeted cable TV channels AZN Television and ImaginAsian aired Korean dramas alongside
        content from China, Japan, India, Thailand and other parts of Asia. The dramas were aimed at the Asian American
        community before the channels dissolved in 2008 and 2011 respectively. In November 2008, Netflix began offering
        several Korean dramas as part of its video selection. In August 2009, DramaFever began offering free subtitled
        video streaming service, with video advertisements, in the United States. Singapore-based Viki streams popular
        Korean dramas across the world including North America, with subtitles in 70 languages. Companies in Asia have
        also designed streaming services available online and as mobile apps targeted towards overseas Asian
        communities. "MobiTV" created by the Sri Lankan company, Bhasha is a streaming service and mobile app aimed at
        the Sri Lankan community and streams Korean dramas dubbed in the Sinhalese language alongside other content
        aired in Sri Lanka. "Roopa", created by the same company, is another service available as a mobile app also
        aimed at the Sri Lankan community, it too streams Korean dramas dubbed in the Sinhalese language. Chinese
        company PPTV is another example, a mobile app, "PPTV网络电视HD" streams Korean dramas aimed at the Chinese community
        alongside content that is primarily available in Mandarin, Cantonese and Korean but also increasingly in
        English. Additionally, Korean dramas are available at online DVD retailers. Some Korean dramas, however, are not
        available for region 1 (North America) encoding and NTSC video format. Amazon offers streaming of Winter Sonata
        for a fee. KBFD-DT in Honolulu, Hawaii broadcasts a majority of Korean dramas on its daily schedule, as well as
        offering the programs on sale at its website and on demand through its K-Life channel on Oceanic Time Warner
        Cable. Another Honolulu outlet, KHII-TV devotes three hours of its Sunday afternoon schedule to Korean dramas.
        KTSF, a channel aimed at the Asian American community in San Francisco, California airs Korean dramas as part of
        its schedule alongside content in Mandarin, Tagalog, Hindi, Korean, Vietnamese, Japanese, Taiwanese and
        Cantonese.
        <br><br>
        Between 2001 and 2002, South America began to absorb Korean programming. The 1997 series Star in My Heart began
        its successful broadcast in Chile, Peru and other countries in the area, but these last two were where More had
        repercussions, including an Ahn Jae-wook fan club founded. In 2002, Winter Sonata, produced by KBS 2TV, became
        the first series in the region to match the success of Meteor Garden, attracting a cult following in Asia.
        Marketing sales, including DVD sets and novels, exceeded $3.5 million in Japan. In 2004, then-Japanese Prime
        Minister Junichiro Koizumi noted that the series' male lead was "more popular than I am in Japan." Other Korean
        dramas released in later years such as Jewel in the Palace (2003) and Full House (2004) had comparable levels of
        success.
        <br><br>
        In Chile, which was one of the first countries on a global level, the phenomenon of Korean wave, which is also
        known as hallyu, began with the first drama aired that was the original 1997 MBC series Star in My Heart in 2001
        by Chilevisión past midnight and later years later in 2003 it was retransmitted by Canal 21 (Chillán) in
        Chillán, but it was not until 2006, when Stairway to Heaven was broadcast at 1:00 pm on the public television
        channel Televisión Nacional de Chile, which achieved notoriety of this genre being compared to La madrastra—an
        old very successful Chilean soap opera—due to the high audience figures in its schedule competing directly with
        other channels, it was also broadcast by TV Chile to other continents dubbed into Spanish.

      <h3>Ratings and viewership</h3>
      <p>Viewership ratings are provided by two companies in South Korea: Nielsen Korea and TNmS. Originally, Media
        Service Korea (MSK) was the sole company providing TV viewership ratings using people meter since 1992, but was
        only limited to Seoul Capital Area. In 1998, TNS Media Korea began as a rival company in partnership with Taylor
        Nelson Sofres (TNS) which extended the service to five major cities; it was officially launched in June 1999
        with a more sophisticated viewership rating survey technique. While, in August 1999, AC Nielsen acquired MSK and
        rebranded it as AC Nielsen Korea and expanded the audience rating survey to the whole country with the aim to
        increase the credibility of the ratings. In 2005, AC Nielsen Korea signed a merger with AGB Group and AGB
        Nielsen Media Research was established. AGB Nielsen Media Research merged with KADD Nielsen Media Research in
        January 2013, and the official name was changed to Nielsen Korea.
        <br><br>
        In 2010, TNS Media Korea was renamed to TNmS (Total National Multimedia Statistics). Since late 2018, TNmS
        stopped providing data to the public through their websites, and instead occasionally releases the ratings
        through news agencies such as BreakNews.
